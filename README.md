Bud Buds is a 2D city builder–farming simulator hybrid where players can purchase and manage multiple plots of land across a large map. 
Players customize their farms, grow crops, trade in markets, and expand their agricultural empire through upgrades and automation.

 Vision

The goal of Bud Buds is to combine relaxing farming gameplay with strategic management. Players make choices about what to grow, how to upgrade, and when to trade — creating their own path to success.
